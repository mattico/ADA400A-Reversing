# Tektronix ADA400A Reverse Engineering

![schematic](Images/ADA400A.svg)

Almost complete, almost correct schematics for the Tektronix ADA400A Differential Preamplifier.
Reverse engineered from [photos on xDevs.com](https://xdevs.com/fix/ada400a/).

The p-JFET (?) input protection is interesting and unique as far as I can tell. Can't find it anywhere else.
